For that, there are many alternatives already."

That is, of course, until it wasn't when it suited their ends (same with Uni post Sushi). Also, as far as money markets are concerned, Compound is the first mover. Ethlend had to rewrite their entire p2p protocol after they got trounced. This happened before Comp, the token, was a thing.  \n\nThe causativeness of tokens to Maker's rise is also dubious considering Maker is even older than Ethereum itself, had no competitors for the longest time, and was flailing until only a couple years ago thanks to CL (oracles), and Compound and Celsius"

There are maybe 30k unique users in crypto. Unless you have a product idea which is specifically well suited (e.g. 10x better or 10x cheaper than existing solutions to a problem you think they have) for that small niche, think WELL outside this bubble.\n2. Most of these users in crypto function on bribes and short term gains. Neither retains users for any period of time.\n3. There aren't more than 10 teams in crypto in total since the whole thing started that lasted more than 3 years. They all go bust because of 1), and because of programmed-in down-only token prices.\n4. VCs in crypto are almost exclusively net negative, extractive, and zero-value-add. Exceptions exist (Signum, Sanctor...) but by and large they are vampiric and will look to you to help them dump on the 30k people.\n\nMy point is... whatever problem you think you're solving, do some user interviews first to make sure you really identified a high value problem to solve, otherwise you will become a solution looking for a problem."

Just checked their twitter and they are still posting which is crazy that they have lasted this long considering the NFT market right now. \n\nBut yeah, TLDR with their GTM was that they hosted a 72 hour mint. The only way to get your wallet whitelisted to mint one was to participate in a giveaway bot on their discord. So this gamified the minting process and tapped into peoples dopamine receptors as FOMO set in. What resulted was like thousands of people in their discord all jumping whenever the giveaway bot dropped a whitelist spot. As soon as someone one a whitelist, they minted then were able to sell for like 20X the value on the open market as people who hadn't secured a whitelist from the giveaway bot were fomoing into the open market listings. I found it interesting and incredibly effective to attract a community so quickly."

Metrics were all over the board and many great native low raise projects didn't get rewarded, though large wealthy projects like uniswap got $1 mil grant because apparently they need the money or no one would use uniswap without it. Lol. Also most of the projects that got approved were established boring low yield defi projects because councils somehow think those are going to drive adoption of your chain. Fyi they're not. No one is going to rush to arbitrum because now an APY went from 2% to 3% with incentives. TVL definitely doesn't equal user growth. Grants need to be more dynamic as well and needs more than 5 ppl to weigh hundreds of applications."
